## Project Objective

The main goal of the project is to develop an AI-based solver for the 15-puzzle using various admissible heuristics and compare their performance. The puzzle is solved by transforming an initial configuration into the goal state using the most efficient sequence of moves guided by search algorithms.

## AI Concepts Used

- State-Space Search
- A* Search Algorithm
- Heuristic Functions
- Uninformed Search (e.g., BFS, DFS)
- Performance Metrics (e.g., nodes expanded, fringe size, execution time)

## Features

- Full support for solving the 15-puzzle
- Multiple heuristics implemented and tested
- Automatic scenario generation and batch testing
- Result logging for performance analysis
- Comparison between heuristic and uninformed search strategies

## How to Use

1. Run the main puzzle solver to solve a single instance.
2. Use the automated script to test multiple puzzle scenarios and compare heuristics.
3. Review the generated results for performance analysis.

No external libraries are required. Written in pure Python.

## Educational Context

This project is part of an introductory course on Artificial Intelligence. The 15-puzzle serves as a powerful model for teaching heuristic search and optimizationâ€”skills that are widely applicable in domains such as robotics, planning, and decision-making systems.
